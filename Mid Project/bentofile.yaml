    ## This is the development of the demand prediction services in BentoML üç±
    Here we deploy a rest API in the endpoint /predict which provides us
    with the prediction of the demand based on the variables we send.
    As an example of the input needed here i let this simple example of payload
    ```json
    [
      {
        "WorkDay": false,
        "Holiday": false,
        "conditions": "Partially cloudy",
        "hour": 0,
        "temp": 7.3,
        "feelslike": 7.3,
        "dew": 5.1,
        "humidity": 85.95,
        "cloudcover": 62.6,
        "visibility": 12.2
      },
      {
        "WorkDay": false,
        "Holiday": false,
        "conditions": "Overcast",
        "hour": 1,
