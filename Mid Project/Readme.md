# Mid project
Here i present my mid project in which i have taken the data of Santander bikes in UK from 1th jannuary to 28 of february, This project is simple and what it tried to do was to predict the demand of bikes at certain hour based in only weather conditions and the fact that the day was a workday or not. The data of Weather conditions was extracted for a free API.

To check out the process in which i start buyilding the data as well as exploring the data and then making a model can be found in this repo
